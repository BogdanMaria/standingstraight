## User Experience (UX)

 ### User Stories:
- #### As a first-time user:
    - I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the topic.
	- I want to easily navigate the website.
	- I want to be able to contact them to book a session or ask further questions.
	
- #### As a returning visitor:
	- I want to be able to navigate to further social media sites to see more work and reviews of the company.
	- I want to easily find a way to contact the business- if I haven’t already.

- #### As a frequent visitor:
    - I want to be able to use the website across multiple devices without too much difference in the site content.

## Design:
### Typography
The font family Lato was chosen for the website navigation menu due to the simplicity of it and font family Roboto has been chosen for the body as it was a nice simple and minimalistic font.
